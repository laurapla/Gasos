\section{Basic requirements of the project}
The main requirement of this study is to get the numerical results as accurate as possible in all the simulation cases.
However, to obtain these results, a knowledge in fluid mechanics is necessary to understand the physics behind each case, as well as some basic programming skills to correctly develop the simulation codes.
Finally, there are no economical or legal requirements because the software used for this study is completely open source. However, the electrical consumption of the computers used to develop and run the simulations may be taken into account.
