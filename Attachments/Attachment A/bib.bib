abstract = {The confined flow around a cylinder with square cross-section mounted inside a plane channel (blockage ratio B = 1/8) was investigated in detail by two entirely different numerical techniques, namely a lattice-Boltzmann automata (LBA) and a finite-volume method (FVM). In order to restrict the approach to 2D computations, the largest Reynolds number chosen was Re = 300 based on the maximum inflow velocity and the chord length of the square cylinder. The LBA was built up on the D2Q9 model and the single relaxation time method called the lattice-BGK method. The finite-volume code was based on an incompressible Navier-Stokes solver for arbitrary non-orthogonal, body-fitted grids. Both numerical methods are of second-order accuracy in space and time. Accurate computations were carried out on grids with different resolutions. The results of both methods were evaluated and compared in detail. Both velocity profiles and integral parameters such as drag coefficient, recirculation length and Strouhal number were investigated. Excellent agreement between the LBA and FVM computations was found. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Ghia1982,
abstract = {The vorticity-stream function formulation of the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is used to study the effectiveness of the coupled strongly implicit multigrid (CSI-MG) method in the determination of high-Re fine-mesh flow solutions. The driven flow in a square cavity is used as the model problem. Solutions are obtained for configurations with Reynolds number as high as 10,000 and meshes consisting of as many as 257 x 257 points. For Re = 1000, the (129 x 129) grid solution required 1.5 minutes of CPU time on the AMDAHL 470 V/6 computer. Because of the appearance of one or more secondary vortices in the flow field, uniform mesh refinement was preferred to the use of one-dimensional grid-clustering coordinate transformations.},
