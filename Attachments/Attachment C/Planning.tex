\chapter{Planning}
According to the project charter the study was divided in five cases: one on conduction, one on convection,  one on radiation, another one on the combination of these heat transfer mechanisms and a practical case. However, instead of radiation, the study has focused in more cases regarding convection, which were more related to the application studied.
