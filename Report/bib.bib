abstract = {This is a graduate text on turbulent flows, an important topic in fluid dynamics. It is up-to-date, comprehensive, designed for teaching, and is based on a course taught by the author at Cornell University for a number of years. The book consists of two parts followed by a number of appendices. Part I provides a general introduction to turbulent flows, how they behave, how they can be described quantitatively, and the fundamental physical processes involved. Part II is concerned with different approaches for modelling or simulating turbulent flows. The necessary mathematical techniques are presented in the appendices. This book is primarily intended as a graduate level text in turbulent flows for engineering students, but it may also be valuable to students in applied mathematics, physics, oceanography and atmospheric sciences, as well as researchers and practising engineers.},

@article{Breuer2000,
abstract = {The confined flow around a cylinder with square cross-section mounted inside a plane channel (blockage ratio B = 1/8) was investigated in detail by two entirely different numerical techniques, namely a lattice-Boltzmann automata (LBA) and a finite-volume method (FVM). In order to restrict the approach to 2D computations, the largest Reynolds number chosen was Re = 300 based on the maximum inflow velocity and the chord length of the square cylinder. The LBA was built up on the D2Q9 model and the single relaxation time method called the lattice-BGK method. The finite-volume code was based on an incompressible Navier-Stokes solver for arbitrary non-orthogonal, body-fitted grids. Both numerical methods are of second-order accuracy in space and time. Accurate computations were carried out on grids with different resolutions. The results of both methods were evaluated and compared in detail. Both velocity profiles and integral parameters such as drag coefficient, recirculation length and Strouhal number were investigated. Excellent agreement between the LBA and FVM computations was found. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

@book{Bejan2013,
abstract = {A new edition of the bestseller on convection heat transfer A revised edition of the industry classic, "Convection Heat Transfer, Fourth Edition, " chronicles how the field of heat transfer has grown and prospered over the last two decades. This new edition is more accessible, while not sacrificing its thorough treatment of the most up-to-date information on current research and applications in the field. One of the foremost leaders in the field, Adrian Bejan has pioneered and taught many of the methods and practices commonly used in the industry today. He continues this book's long-standing role as an inspiring, optimal study tool by providing: Coverage of how convection affects performance, and how convective flows can be configured so that performance is enhanced How convective configurations have been evolving, from the flat plates, smooth pipes, and single-dimension fins of the earlier editions to new populations of configurations: tapered ducts, plates with multiscale features, dendritic fins, duct and plate assemblies (packages) for heat transfer density and compactness, etc. New, updated, and enhanced examples and problems that reflect the author's research and advances in the field since the last edition A solutions manual Complete with hundreds of informative and original illustrations, "Convection Heat Transfer, Fourth Edition" is the most comprehensive and approachable text for students in schools of mechanical engineering.},

abstract = {The vorticity-stream function formulation of the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is used to study the effectiveness of the coupled strongly implicit multigrid (CSI-MG) method in the determination of high-Re fine-mesh flow solutions. The driven flow in a square cavity is used as the model problem. Solutions are obtained for configurations with Reynolds number as high as 10,000 and meshes consisting of as many as 257 x 257 points. For Re = 1000, the (129 x 129) grid solution required 1.5 minutes of CPU time on the AMDAHL 470 V/6 computer. Because of the appearance of one or more secondary vortices in the flow field, uniform mesh refinement was preferred to the use of one-dimensional grid-clustering coordinate transformations.},
