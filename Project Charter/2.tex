\section{Scope}
First, some basic cases concerning the equations of mass, momentum and energy are going to be solved in order to learn the fundamentals of the mathematical formulation and the computational and programming techniques that are going to be needed to develop the whole study. With the help of these cases, some simulation codes are going to be developed.
\newline
A second part of this paper is going to be the application of the knowledge acquired to a practical case, that may be an engineering system or any other physical system.
\newline
\newline
In order to accomplish the objectives mentioned above, these are the following tasks to be developed:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Previous research of the state of the art.
	\item Theoretical approach of the fluid dynamics behind all the cases and study of the mathematical formulation that should be applied.
	\item Development of the necessary numerical simulation tools. All the codes will need to be validated to ensure they are correct.
	\item Application of the acquired knowledge in simulation codes to an specific system.
	\item Analysis of the results.
	\item Conclusions.
\end{itemize}
