\section{Requirements}
The objective of the study is to develop computational tools for the resolution of problems involving the conservation equations of mass, momentum and energy. Therefore, the main requirement is to obtain accurate and realistic numerical results in all the simulation cases.
\newline
However, to obtain these results, a knowledge in fluid dynamics is necessary to understand the physics behind each case, as well as some basic programming skills to correctly develop the simulation codes.
\newline
Finally, there are no economical or legal requirements because the software used for this study is completely open source.
